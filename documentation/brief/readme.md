# Brief

This is a live project, with a real-world client.

In todayâ€™s global environment where companies are selling products worldwide to multiple end users, through life supportability to both Hardware and Software solutions becomes critical and integral to any solution.

With Open Source software tools becoming readily available on the market (for example Elasticsearch (https://www.elastic.co/) with Kibana (https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana)) the possibility of integrating tools to support service monitoring, reliability prediction, fault prediction, routine and preventative maintenance scheduling of distributed systems should be a lot easier.

Enhancements in the use of HUMS (Health Usage and Monitoring Service) will allow for improved reliability, improved supportability and targeted technology refresh in a timely manner.

The scope of this project is to exploit 3rd party open source tools to demonstrate how data can be collected, managed, navigated and analysed from distributed systems to improve the supportability of products in the market.
